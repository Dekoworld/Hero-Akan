    <br><h1>HERO-AKAN</h1><br><br><br><br>
    <br><p>I am a Kwadwo, wordering what it means?Well got a chance to visit
     Ghana a beautiful African country,interacted with the people and 
     their way of living. <br>
     Something that really struck me was the ways they used to name 
     new-borns.<br>
    Using the Akan names.A child is named according to the day
    of the week she/he was born.<br><br>
    Now you know what Kwadwo means. <br>

    the week you were born and your Akan.</p>
